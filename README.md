# Stock Comparison

A free, no-sign-up tool for comparing stocks/ETFs and backtesting portfolios —
**growth, risk, and correlation, side by side.** Two modes:

- **Compare** — type some tickers and get a normalized growth chart, a sortable
  risk/return table, and a correlation heatmap.
- **Portfolio** — define weighted holdings, choose a rebalance frequency and a
  benchmark, and backtest the blended portfolio against it.

Every view is encoded in the URL, so any comparison or portfolio is a
copy-pasteable link.

**Backend:** FastAPI + yfinance + pandas, with a TTL cache and dependency
injection. **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Plotly,
with React Query for server state and the URL as the source of truth for shared
state. The UI follows Linear's design language — a near-black canvas, hairline
borders, an indigo accent, crisp typography.

> It started life as a 7-stock daily-returns viewer (the MAG7), grew a
> comparison engine for arbitrary tickers, then a portfolio backtester. The
> original `GET /returns` endpoint and contract are still present and tested —
> everything since has been additive.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Node 20+, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
(or pip if you prefer).

**Backend (terminal 1):**

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                                # or: python -m venv .venv && pip install -e .
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # serves http://localhost:8000
```

**Frontend (terminal 2):**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                            # serves http://localhost:5173
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). It loads with a default
comparison (the leaders vs. the S&P 500 over five years). Add or remove tickers,
change the range, hit **Share link**. API docs are auto-generated at
[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

---

## What it does

**Compare mode** — enter up to 10 tickers (stocks or ETFs) and a date range:

- **Growth of $1** — every ticker rebased to 1.0 at the common start date and
  overlaid on one shared axis, so magnitudes are directly comparable. Linear/log
  toggle for multi-fold differences.
- **Risk & return table** — total return, CAGR, annualized volatility, Sharpe,
  max drawdown, best/worst day, and trading-day count per ticker. Sortable.
- **Return correlation** — a heatmap of pairwise daily-return correlations, so
  diversifiers (low/negative correlation) stand out from names that move together.

Plus quick presets (MAG7, MAG7 vs. S&P 500, the index ETFs), a warning when a
typo'd symbol has no data, the shareable URL, and a **⌘K command palette** for
switching modes, applying a preset, or setting a date range from the keyboard.

**Portfolio mode** — define weighted holdings, pick a rebalance frequency
(buy & hold, monthly, quarterly, annually) and an optional benchmark:

- The blended **portfolio's value is backtested** day by day — holdings drift
  between rebalances and snap back to target weights on each rebalance boundary
  — then plotted as growth of $1 against the benchmark.
- The same **risk/return table** compares the portfolio to the benchmark; a
  **benchmark-relative panel** adds beta, annualized alpha, R², tracking error,
  and information ratio; a **calendar-year returns** chart + table shows
  year-by-year performance vs. the benchmark (partial first/last years flagged);
  and a **holdings breakdown** shows each name's weight, **share of portfolio
  risk** (which can diverge from weight — flagging concentration), total return,
  and weighted contribution.

Weights are entered raw and shown normalized to 100%; an "Equal weight" button
balances them. A dropped (no-data) holding renormalizes the rest.

```

**Separation of concerns is the central design choice.** Every external
dependency (yfinance, the cache, the request) sits behind a `Protocol`, so the
business logic — `app/services/analytics.py` — is a set of pure functions on a
DataFrame. The math is trivially testable and the route handler stays boring.

On the frontend, the same idea: a typed API client below a React Query hook
below presentational components. Components don't know about `fetch`, caching,
or retries — only the shape of the data they render.

---

## Key decisions

### The common window

When tickers have different histories (a 2021 IPO vs. an index going back
decades), **every series is restricted to the dates they all share.** Three
reasons:

1. Growth curves can be rebased to a common start — every line begins at 1.0
   on the same date, so the chart compares like with like.
2. Correlation is only defined on aligned observations.
3. CAGR / volatility / Sharpe over a window are comparable only if the window
   is identical across tickers.

The cost: the youngest ticker constrains the window. The effective range and
its trading-day count are reported back (`window` in the response) and shown in
the UI, so the trade-off is never hidden. Tickers the upstream has no data for
are reported in `missing` rather than failing the whole request.

### Growth from prices, not re-compounded returns

The growth curve is `price_t / price_0` over the common window — exact, and it
starts at precisely 1.0 on day one. (Re-compounding daily returns would drift
on floating-point error and is needlessly indirect when we already hold prices.)
Returns for the stats and correlation are derived from the same aligned prices,
so every number on the page comes from one consistent source.

### The portfolio value is "just a price"

The portfolio backtest produces a daily **value series starting at 1.0**, then
feeds it into the *same* growth/stats/correlation functions as everything else —
a portfolio behaves exactly like a synthetic price. So the chart, risk table,
and correlation matrix needed zero new rendering code; portfolio mode is a new
endpoint plus one simulation function (`simulate_portfolio_value`).

The simulation tracks per-holding value: each holding drifts with its own daily
return, and on a rebalance boundary (first trading day of each month/quarter/year)
the holdings reset to target weights against the current total. `none` is
buy-and-hold (weights drift forever). Weights are merged across duplicate tickers,
normalized to sum to 1, and renormalized again if a holding has no data.

### Adjusted close prices, not raw

Everything is computed from split- and dividend-adjusted closes
(`yfinance auto_adjust=True`), so it reflects **total return** — what a
shareholder actually experienced. Raw closes would inject spurious drops on
ex-dividend and split days.

### Server-computed statistics

Growth, stats, and correlation are computed on the backend, on the full
(aligned) daily series. The frontend never re-derives them — guaranteeing the
chart, table, and heatmap agree, and keeping numbers exact even when the charted
growth series is downsampled (LTTB, `MAX_CHART_POINTS = 2000`) for long ranges.

### The URL is the state

The entire app state — mode, tickers/holdings, weights, rebalance, benchmark, and
range — lives in the query string, mirrored via `history.replaceState`. No
accounts, no database, no router dependency — yet every comparison *and* every
portfolio is a shareable link, and a bare visit falls back to a sensible default.
This is the cheapest possible "share" feature: it costs zero backend.

### Dependency injection over module globals

The cache and price fetcher are wired via FastAPI's `Depends()` system, backed
by `lru_cache`-singletons. Tests override them via `app.dependency_overrides` —
no monkeypatching, no fragile import paths. Each endpoint gets its own cache
(keyed by its full input), injected the same way.

### React Query for server state, Plotly for charts

React Query handles request dedup, caching, retries, and loading/error states
for one dependency. Plotly ships zoom, pan, hover, legends, and a heatmap out of
the box and stays performant on multi-year ranges; the cost is bundle size (see
"What I'd do next").

### shadcn/ui + Tailwind, Linear's design language

The UI is built on hand-authored [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) primitives
(Radix + Tailwind v4) — owned, dependency-light component code rather than a
black-box library — styled to mimic Linear: a near-black cool canvas with a faint
indigo glow, hairline borders, the `#5e6ad2` accent, and crisp headings with tight
tracking. The data-heavy widgets are headless and free: the sortable tables use
**TanStack Table**, the date range uses **react-day-picker**, the rebalance picker
a **Radix Select**, and the ⌘K palette **cmdk**. Motion is **tw-animate-css** (the
Radix open/close transitions plus a staggered results reveal), gated behind
`prefers-reduced-motion` — honored both via a CSS guard and a hook that drops the
animation machinery entirely. No component library license, no paywalled pieces.

---

## API contract

### `GET /compare`

Query params: `tickers` (comma-separated, e.g. `AAPL,MSFT,SPY`; 1–10),
`start`, `end` (ISO dates, inclusive).

```json
{
  "growth": {
    "AAPL": [{ "date": "2020-06-08", "value": 1.0 }, { "date": "...", "value": 3.41 }]
  },
  "stats": {
    "AAPL": {
      "total_return": 2.41, "cagr": 0.28, "annual_vol": 0.31, "sharpe": 0.95,
      "max_drawdown": -0.31, "best": 0.12, "worst": -0.13, "count": 1258
    }
  },
  "correlation": { "tickers": ["AAPL", "SPY"], "matrix": [[1.0, 0.78], [0.78, 1.0]] },
  "window": { "start": "2020-06-08", "end": "2025-06-06", "trading_days": 1258 },
  "missing": []
}
```

All values are fractions (`0.28` == +28%). `tickers` are normalized server-side
(uppercased, deduped). A range with no trading data, or tickers whose histories
don't overlap, returns a **422** with a clear message; a genuine upstream
failure returns a **502** (so the UI offers retry only when retrying could help).

### `GET /portfolio`

Query params: `tickers` and `weights` (parallel comma-separated lists; weights
optional → equal-weight), `rebalance` (`none`|`monthly`|`quarterly`|`annually`),
`benchmark` (optional symbol), `start`, `end`.

```json
{
  "growth": {
    "Portfolio": [{ "date": "2020-06-08", "value": 1.0 }, { "date": "...", "value": 2.6 }],
    "SPY":       [{ "date": "2020-06-08", "value": 1.0 }, { "date": "...", "value": 1.9 }]
  },
  "stats": {
    "Portfolio": { "total_return": 1.6, "cagr": 0.21, "annual_vol": 0.24, "sharpe": 0.9, "max_drawdown": -0.28, "best": 0.09, "worst": -0.1, "count": 1258 },
    "SPY":       { "total_return": 0.9, "cagr": 0.14, "annual_vol": 0.18, "sharpe": 0.8, "max_drawdown": -0.25, "best": 0.09, "worst": -0.11, "count": 1258 }
  },
  "correlation": { "tickers": ["Portfolio", "SPY"], "matrix": [[1.0, 0.93], [0.93, 1.0]] },
  "window": { "start": "2020-06-08", "end": "2025-06-06", "trading_days": 1258 },
  "holdings": [{ "ticker": "AAPL", "weight": 0.4, "risk_contribution": 0.46, "total_return": 2.41 }],
  "annual": [{ "year": 2020, "partial": true, "returns": { "Portfolio": 0.21, "SPY": 0.12 } }],
  "benchmark": "SPY",
  "benchmark_metrics": {
    "benchmark": "SPY", "beta": 1.15, "alpha": 0.04, "r_squared": 0.88,
    "tracking_error": 0.06, "information_ratio": 0.65, "correlation": 0.94
  },
  "missing": []
}
```

`growth`/`stats`/`correlation`/`annual` are keyed by `"Portfolio"` and the
benchmark, so the same chart/table components render them. Each `annual` entry
chains from the prior year-end (so the yearly returns compound to the total) and
flags a `partial` first/last year. `benchmark_metrics` is the regression of the
portfolio's daily returns on the benchmark's (null when no benchmark is set or
there's too little overlap). Weights are merged across duplicate tickers and
normalized to sum to 1.

### `GET /returns`

The original MAG7 daily-returns endpoint, unchanged. See git history / the
`stats` + `returns` contract in `app/models.py`.

---

## The metrics, defined

So there's no ambiguity about what the numbers mean:

- **Total return** — `price_last / price_first − 1` over the common window.
- **CAGR** — `(1 + total_return) ^ (1 / years) − 1`, where `years` is the
  window's trading-day count ÷ 252 (consistent with the volatility convention).
- **Annualized volatility** — sample standard deviation of daily returns × √252.
- **Sharpe** — `mean(daily) / std(daily) × √252`, **risk-free rate = 0**. A
  fine default for a free comparison tool; documented so it's not mistaken for
  an excess-return Sharpe.
- **Max drawdown** — the most negative `price / running-peak − 1` over the
  window (a non-positive fraction; 0 if the series only rose).
- **Best / worst day** — the largest single-day gain and loss.
- **Days** — trading-day observations in the common window.

Portfolio mode adds **benchmark-relative** metrics, from the regression of the
portfolio's daily returns on the benchmark's (risk-free rate = 0):

- **Beta** — `cov(portfolio, benchmark) / var(benchmark)`; sensitivity to the
  benchmark (1.0 moves one-for-one).
- **Alpha** — Jensen's alpha: the daily regression intercept
  `mean(portfolio) − beta × mean(benchmark)`, annualized geometrically.
- **R²** — squared correlation; the fraction of the portfolio's variance the
  benchmark explains.
- **Tracking error** — annualized standard deviation of the active
  (portfolio − benchmark) daily return.
- **Information ratio** — annualized active return ÷ tracking error.

And a **per-holding risk contribution**, decomposing portfolio variance with the
target weights and the holdings' return covariance:

- `σ_p² = wᵀΣw`; each holding's component contribution `CTR_i = w_i (Σw)_i`
  sums to `σ_p²` (Euler's theorem), so the **percent contribution to risk**
  `PCR_i = CTR_i / σ_p²` sums to 1. Because `Σw` carries covariances, a volatile
  or highly-correlated name can contribute more risk than its weight — a
  diversifier less.

Degenerate inputs (a single common day, a zero-variance series, a flat
benchmark) yield zeros, not `NaN`/`inf`, so the JSON is always valid and the UI
never shows garbage.

---

## Assumptions

- **Date range is inclusive on both ends.** yfinance's `end` is exclusive; the
  backend adjusts internally so the API behaves intuitively.
- **Non-trading days are absent, not zero.** Weekends/holidays don't appear.
- **Comparison window = the overlap.** See "The common window."
- **No artificial range cap — full history is supported,** bounded only by what
  yfinance has. Long charted series are downsampled (LTTB) for payload size;
  the stats are computed on the full aligned series, so they stay exact.
- **The TTL cache is 5 minutes.** Keys carry the full input — for `/compare`
  `(sorted tickers, start, end)`; for `/portfolio` the sorted holdings+weights,
  rebalance, benchmark, and range — so reorderings are cache hits.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv run pytest -v          # 67 tests
uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy app

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test                  # 45 tests
npx tsc -b && npx eslint .
```

**Backend** covers the analytics math (common-window alignment, growth rebasing,
CAGR/vol/Sharpe, max drawdown, correlation, degenerate inputs, downsampling, and
the portfolio simulation incl. rebalancing vs. buy-and-hold), calendar-year chaining + partial-year flagging, benchmark-relative metrics
(beta/alpha/R²/tracking error/information ratio), risk-contribution decomposition
(equal split for uncorrelated equal-vol holdings, concentration in the volatile
one), the cache, and all endpoints
end-to-end (happy path, ticker/weight normalization & validation, missing-holding
renormalization, no-overlap → 422, no-data → 422, upstream → 502, cache hits)
against a fake price fetcher.

**Frontend** covers the formatters, the comparison table, the ticker input and
portfolio builder (normalization, validation, cap, weights, equalize, remove),
the holdings table (weight-vs-risk divergence flags), the benchmark-metrics and
calendar-year panels, the ⌘K command palette (mode switch, presets, range, share,
filtering), the staggered reveal (stagger + reduced-motion opt-out), the
URL-state hook (hydrate + mirror for both modes), and the app
end-to-end via MSW (compare default load, portfolio-mode backtest, ⌘K shortcut,
missing-ticker warning, 422 shown verbatim with no retry, 502 with
retry-and-recover). The Plotly charts are mocked because jsdom has no canvas;
every other path runs for real. External dependencies (yfinance, the network)
are never hit in tests.

---

## What I'd do next

In roughly the order I'd tackle them:

1. **Trim the bundle.** Plotly is ~80% of it. Most of the app needs only
   `plotly.js-basic-dist`; the heatmap is the lone holdout, so lazy-load the
   correlation view (or its Plotly bundle) behind a dynamic import.
2. **SEO & programmatic landing pages** — the URL already encodes the full state,
   so every comparison is an indexable page. Add SSR/pre-rendering with dynamic
   `<title>`/meta/H1, then statically generate the long-tail (top-N pairwise
   ticker combos, popular ETF trios, named portfolios) to capture
   "AAPL vs MSFT total return", "free portfolio backtester no signup", etc.
   Full keyword research and the build-out checklist live in [`docs/seo.md`](docs/seo.md).
3. **Rolling views** — rolling correlation and rolling volatility, for when a
   single window-wide number hides a regime change.
4. **Redis cache** behind the existing `Cache` protocol (no call-site changes).
5. **Symbol search/validation** — resolve and disambiguate tickers as the user
   types, instead of discovering a typo only after the request.
6. **Configuration via `pydantic-settings`** sourced from the environment.
7. **CI** (GitHub Actions): pytest + ruff + mypy; vitest + tsc + eslint.
8. **Risk-free input** for an excess-return Sharpe, for users who want it.
